This is the intoduction to PowerBi where the Data Visualization is done.


Bussiness report gives us a overview information about the customer satisfaction and it consists of charts that describe the information which is to be improved for the better outcome in bussiness.

Total sales consists of information about the sales in bar charts and it is used to conclude the bonus to top three sellers of the company.

In time series data we get a clear picture of how sales performance is going on whether it is increasing or decreasing and it also gives an idea such that company can decide in which season the offer should be provided.
